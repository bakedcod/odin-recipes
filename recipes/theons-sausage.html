    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Theons favorite toy wrapped in puff pastry and fried to perfection!</p>
        <p>“Those girls weren’t lying, you had a good sized cock. What? No…pork sausage. 
            What, you think I’m some sort of savage?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- <em>Ramsey Bolton</em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>"Sausage"</em></li>
            <li>Puff Pastry</li>
            <li>Cheddar Cheese</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>Sesame Seeds</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400° F</li>
            <li>(optional) Boil hot dogs according to package instruction, or for pre-cooked brats, pan-sear until brown.</li>
            <li>Divide the puff pastry in half, and then halve it again. Place cheese in the middle of each pastry diagonally and place the hot dog (or bratwurst) on top.</li>
            <li>Beat the egg with a bit of water to make an egg wash.</li>
            <li>Wet the edges of the pastry with some water and fold each sheet over the sausage. Seal with a fork and brush each pocket with egg wash. Sprinkle with sesame seed and kosher salt (optional).</li>
            <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes until golden. Serve with BBQ sauce.</li>
        </ol>
